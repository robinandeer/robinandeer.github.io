## Tagline
**Analyze VCFs quicker and easier.**

## Concept
Scout makes your life easier by letting you visualize mutiple VCFs in a browser. You can quickly triage variants in search of those sneeky disease causing mutations. Scout also connects your team by linking user comments to cases and variants. The project is developed completely in open source.

## Story
Scout was first developed as a simple interface to replace an unwieldly Excel sheet for delivering DNA sequencing results to clinicians. To say the least, it has evoled a lot since then.

Today, Scout is the main portal for delivering all results at [Clinical Genomics][clinical] at SciLifeLab. Clinicians log in via a Google account and can see various cases they are working on.

## Links
You can find the [code][repo] on GitHub and the official [documentation][docs] is also hosted on GitHub Pages.
