## Tagline
**Analyze VCFs quicker and easier.**

## Concept
Scout makes your life easier by letting you visualize mutiple VCFs in a browser. You can quickly triage variants in search of those sneeky disease causing mutations. Scout also connects your team by linking user comments to cases and variants. The project is developed completely in open source.
