## Concept
Meet Chanjo, a bioinformatics tool for use in clinical genomics. Very simply
Chanjo analyzes the quality of [DNA sequencing][dna] data which is important for knowing if derived results can be trusted. More specifically, we're talking about *coverage* in the sense: "how many reads overlap a given range of DNA bases".

## Story
**Chanjo** is by far my most accomplished project. For much of my brief career as a bioinformatician it has stayed as my main professional focus. It currently has reached version 2.3.0 a.k.a *Wistful Weasel*.

The branding of Chanjo definitely stands out amongst your average bioinformatics tools. Utilitarianism will often delegate visual identity way down the todo-list. I find joy in walking the opposite way. For Chanjo this meant hijacking the face of a raccon to act as it's logo and mascot. I find that many times just adding that extra bit of visual polish can go a long way in thinking better of and remembering your project.

## Technology
Chanjo is written in pure Python, only relying on a few C-extensions wrapped in Python APIs.
