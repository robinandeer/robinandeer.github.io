_This will be a living document that I will keep updating as I explore more of the vegan options that Stockholm has to offer. The list includes anything from cafés, restaurants, supermarkets, etc._

----------------------

Roughly in chronological order:

## Lao Wai
**Chinese** ($$). Absolutely fantastic food and great mood. They take lunch orders as well as provide a cozy atmosphere for a great dinner. If you're attending as a group make sure to order different plates and share! *Everything is vegan* with lots of soy variants. Small place, book ahead. [More information](http://www.laowai.se/).

## Hermitage
**International** ($).Resonable price for the lunch buffé where almost everything is vegan. Very tasty and a place to come hungry and eat *a lot*. They also have a selection of vegan desserts that makes it a great option for a fika. [More information](http://gastrogate.com/restaurang/hermitage/).

## Every vegan pizza place
So far disappointing. Everyone just tries to replace non-vegan ingredients with soy options (soy-ham, soy-cheese...). Boring and never as tasty. Make your own!

## Texas Longhorn Steakhouse
**American** ($$). Have a vegan double-burger that's not on the menu. One of the more expensive items, however. Comes with sides that add flavor to a pretty bland burger in my oppinion. Still nothing compared to something like Burgermeister in Berlin, hehe! [More information](http://www.texaslonghorn.se/restaurant/hornstull/).

## Nem Nem Quan
**Vietnamese**. No particular memories of the food but probably OK :-)

## Citykonditoriet
Feel a little posh and not very cozy. Big place. Has a number of vegan options that are clearly marked as such! One (at least) vegan cake per day.

## Bagel Street Hornstull by [@guillemch](https://twitter.com/guillemch)
The place is cosy and big. The waitress was very nice with me, speaking slowly in swedish :).  The "maxi vegan" bagel was delicious! A bit difficult to eat though because it was packed of goods :_). Wifi and good coffee, what else? Perfect! Sliiightly expensive. [More information](http://www.bagelstreet.se/).

## K25
**International**. Lots of choices, world food court. Inexpensive but quite noisy. Not cozy at all.. Plenty of vegan options though. I had a quite tasty bibimbap. Probably better for take away.

## Hattori Sushi Devil
**Japanese** ($$). Very nice and varied vegetarian sushi for 150:-. Not a lot of other options though for vegans.

## Koreana
**Korean** ($). My new favorite place. Have always order take-away though but they are very quick to order! Super tasty vegetarian bibimbap for only 78:-!

## Steam
Very tasty vegetarian dumplings, mostly to-go for 92:-. I have yet to try the veggo salad which looks amazing. I did try the "Laotisk sojagryta", another winner!

## Babel Deli
**Middle eastern** ($). Reasonable prices, several vegan options which are clearly marked (!). Looks yummy and tastes great! Remember you can ask for quinoa instead of bulgur.

## Organic Green
**Soul food** ($).Very nice, wholesome vegetarian soul food. It seems most dishes aren't 100% vegan but the ones that are probably beat most other options. Everything comes with hummous, sallad, and bread. And what bread - sublime. Grab an extra slice while your at it.

## Reggev Hummus
**Middle eastern** ($). The concept is hummus with something. Wonderfully simple *and* I love hummus. You also get bread and pickled vegetabels on the side. I will go here as often as I get the chance :smile:
