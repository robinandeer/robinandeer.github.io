## Day 1
After a less than ideal breakfast, me and [Johan Dahlberg][johan] headed to Trinity College for the first day of the Codefest hackathon. We got there well in time to meet with Brad Chapman who organizes the event.

The day started out with introductions to give people an idea of who is there and what everyone is keen on hacking on for the next couple of days. Three groups take form: a very large Common Workflow Language (CWL) group, an R group working on a web interface, and a BioPython group resolving outstanding issues.

I'm joining one small corner of the CWL group. First on the agenda is an improvised intro to the project. We don't start out with any clear goal. After trying to install and run some simple examples we kind of slip into figuring out how to make the reference implementation run on Mac using the Docker integration. By the end of the day we have a fix in an open pull request :smiley: When the changes are merged we will be official contributors of CWL.

## Day 2
