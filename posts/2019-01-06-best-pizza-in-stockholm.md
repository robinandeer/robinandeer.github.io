## Giro - Sveavägen 46

| 🍕 Melanzane (mozzarella and zucchini) |
|---------------------------------------|
| 💳 159 SEK                             |
| 🗓 December 2018                       |
| 🙂 Decent                              |

Bread is really good but on the chewy side. Crust is very thick but juicy. The pizza feels soggy in the middle - too much tomato sauce. The cheese is glumpy like it's not melted enough and therefore poorly distributed. Flavors are really nice. Not so greasy - didn't feel too full after the pizza.

## The Italian Cousins - Hornsgatan 68

| 🍕 Margarita, Patate (potato, mozzarella, rosemary) |
|---------------------------------------|
| 💳 145 SEK (3 slices)                  |
| 🗓 January 2019                        |
| 😍 Awesome!                            |

Very cripsy bread. More like bruschetta than regular pizza bread. In a very pleasant way! You easily pick it up without any mess and only slightly oily fingers. The ingredients are super fresh. Quite traditional but my favorite was the potato, mozzarella, and rosemary slice! Price is quite expensive but you get to taste several different pizza flavors. You easily get full with 2-3 slices á 50 sek each.
