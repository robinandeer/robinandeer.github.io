I have quite recently discovered the pleasure and exhilaration that nicknames offer. Equally of assigning them to others and being assigned ones yourself. It's so satisfying when something really fits.

For me it's about paying enough attention to pick up on something characterizing in another person. That's a beautiful concept. It's one of my favorite ways to show affection and respectively the most effective way to make me feel special. After spending an intense week in Dublin, this has never been more true. It's just too bad we don't show affection more.

I have one nickname that seems obviouis enough and would fit me perfectly! Obviously that's not how it works. Most of the time. Forced nicknames can absolutely work, but they are rarely the ones that stick. Still I'm holding out a little hope :wink:
