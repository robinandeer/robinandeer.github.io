          Dear {contactName},
				</p>

				<p className='max-w-2xl'>
					Please accept my application for the {role} position with {company}. I hope to bring my 10 years of software engineering experience to your team. In the past years I have gained expertise in TypeScript, React, web accessibility, and API design. I believe I would be an excellent addition to the {company} engineering team.
				</p>

				<p className='max-w-2xl'>
					During my time at Hedvig, my current company, I have served as the lead developer for a team of 4-6 engineers. The biggest project included a complete revamp of the company website, which I designed and architected. This led to a 40% reduction in the size of the codebase and significant improvements in Lighthouse scores and SEO ranking. I have also been a mentor for junior developers and have helped them grow their skills.
				</p>

				<p className='max-w-2xl'>
          I am currently based in Stockholm, Sweden but will move to New York in December, 2023. Iâ€™m authorized to work under an L-2 Visa as a dependent on my husband.
				</p>

				<p className='max-w-2xl'>
					Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions you would like to discuss. I look forward to hearing from you.
				</p>

				<p>
					With optimism,<br />
					Robin Andeer
